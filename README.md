# Introduction
    1. This is a collection of different bugs I have seen. Some of them are trivial, but some are weird.
    2. I will keep collecting more bugs and upload the bug code to this repo.
  
# Structure
    1. bugs are divided into different programming language, each language has a folder.
    2. Collected bugs are put in separate folders with appropriate name.
    3. Inside the folder, a bug code is provided, executable or runnable files is provided if able.
    4. Inside the folder, a bug fixed code is provided if there is a good way to solve the bug. README is provided for explanation.
  
# Standard
    1. Comments when necessary
    2. Bug code hould not point out where the bug is, whereas the bug fixed code should.
    3. The string "horst" must appear in the bug code, no matter in what way.
    4. The cause and solving method should be explained in README or in bug fixed code if the bug is not trivial.
    5. The code file should not contain too much code that is completely irrelevant to the bug.
    6. ANY language are welcomed (C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript, html, Mips, x86, SQL, XQuery ...), ANY!
